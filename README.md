# Notes To Go Note Taker

## Description

This is a note taking application that allows the user to create and save, notes. The application uses an express backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. The application is deployed on Heroku. Users can click on their previously saved notes and see them expanded on the right side of the screen. This project was put together to work on my skills with express.js and Heroku.

## Installation

Installation is only required if you are running locally and not through Heroku. To install the necessary dependencies, first clone the project repository from Github @ https://github.com/TamasPinter/notesToGo . Open the repository in your code editor and run "npm i" from the terminal. This will install all dependencies and packages needed to run the application. Once the installation is complete, run "npm start" from the terminal. This will start the server and the application will be running on localhost:3001.

If you are accessing through Heroku at https://tamaspinternotestogo.herokuapp.com/ , no installation is required.

## Usage

Once you are installed locally or on Heroku, you can start using the application. Click on the "Get Started" button to start creating notes. You can enter a title and a note body. Once you have entered your note, click on the save icon on the top right corner of the screen. Your note will be saved and you can see it on the left side of the screen. You can click on the note to see it expanded on the right side of the screen.
